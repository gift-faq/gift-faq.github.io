**Q: What is the typical OpenShift deployment size in terms of IFL/Core count on Z?**

There are several source of informations:

1. [RHOCP Reference Architecture. see sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.3](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/linux390/docu/RHOCP-reference-architecture.pdf)

2. [IBM Seller Presentation OpenShift with IBM Z](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC9gFmFP4GmDj822Q64Fd7JbpXMV)
